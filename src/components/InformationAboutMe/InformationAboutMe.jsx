          I'm currently doing some web design stuff at GitHub. I'm used to working in fast-paced environments and collaborating
          with interdisciplinary teams. My specialty is web design but have been enjoying creating all sorts of visuals like
          icons, illustrations and prototypes.
          <br />

          I'm a generalist focused on craft. My formula is doing the work, it's that simple (and hard). I'd label my design
          approach as realistic, supported by skills in frontend development â€” all that to say that I (roughly) know how to
          translate designs into code and understand the constraints of the digital ecosystem. You can follow my work on
          dribbble or (very occasional) case study on Behance.
